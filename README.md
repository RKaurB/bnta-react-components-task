# Exercise - Components

In this exercise we will consider how to break down a web page into components before taking a look at some of the things we can do with them.

## Task:

### Part 1:

Wireframe a single-page application for a recipe website. Your page should have:

* Title
* Navigation
* A search bar
* A display of recipes
* A form to submit a new recipe

Think about how your design could be broken down into reusable components and highlight these on the wireframe. These could be quite abstract, for example a sign-up form and a submission form might have some overlap in functionality and might not need their own components. Use a tool like Excalidraw (for example) for show and tell purposes!

### Part 2:

Create a new React app to practise making components. For each bullet point make a component and implement the required functionality there.

* Display some text saying "Welcome to the Bakery!"
* Display an image of a cake from the internet. If you like you can store it locally, but you may need to do some research into how to manage images within a React app for this.
* Map the cake objects below and for each cake display its name followed by a list of the ingredients. At the bottom of the component show the average cake rating.


```
cakes = [
    {
        cakeName: "Lemon Drizzle",
        ingredients: ["eggs", "butter", "lemon  zest", "sugar", "self-raising flour"],
        rating: 5
    },
    {
        cakeName: "Tea Loaf",
        ingredients: ["eggs", "oil", "dried fruit", "sugar", "self-raising flour", "strong tea"],
        rating: 3
    },
    {
        cakeName: "Brownie",
        ingredients: ["chocolate", "eggs", "flour", "butter", "walnuts"],
        rating: 4
    },
    {
        cakeName: "Carrot Cake",
        ingredients: ["carrots", "walnuts", "oil", "cream cheese", "flour", "sugar"],
        rating: 5
    }
]
```

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
